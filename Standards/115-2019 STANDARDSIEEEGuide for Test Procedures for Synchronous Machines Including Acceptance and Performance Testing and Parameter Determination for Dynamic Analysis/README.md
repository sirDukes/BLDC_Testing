# Measuring BLDC losses 
The following methods are available to measure the losses of a synchronous machine:
- Method 1. Separate drive
- Method 2. Electric input
- Method 3. Retardation
- Method 4. Heat transfer

Each of the first three methods of loss determination requires the machine to be operated for two series of runs  to  simulate  load  conditions,  one  with  the  armature  terminals  open-circuited  and  another  with  them  short-circuited.  For  the  heat  transfer  method,  the  machine  may  be  operated  either  with  load  or  with  simulated load conditions.

If the armature terminals are open-circuited, the total loss includes friction and windage of all mechanically connected apparatus and the open-circuit core loss corresponding to the armature voltage and frequency. If the armature terminals are short-circuited, the total  loss  includes  friction  and  windage  of  all  mechanically  connected apparatus and the armature copper loss and stray-load loss corresponding to the armature current and frequency. 

Open-circuit  losses  can  include  non-negligible  losses  associated  with  circulating  currents  that  are  induced  in the stator winding, especially at voltages above 105% of rated voltage.
